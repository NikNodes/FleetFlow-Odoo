## 🚚 FleetFlow – Fleet Management Command Center

FleetFlow is a full‑stack fleet management prototype built for learning and experimentation.  
It simulates a modern SaaS command center for logistics teams, with role‑based access, real‑time fleet state, and MySQL‑backed persistence.

The project is split into:
- `frontend/` – React + Vite single‑page application (SPA)
- `backend/` – Node.js + Express API with MySQL

### ⚙️ Backend: Setup and Configuration

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. **Configure database connection**

Create `backend/.env` with your MySQL credentials:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your_mysql_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=fleetflow
```

3. **Ensure MySQL database exists**

Connect to MySQL and create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE fleetflow
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

4. **Start backend**

```bash
cd backend
npm run start
```

On first run the server will:
- Connect to `fleetflow` database
- Create tables if they do not exist:
  - `users`
  - `vehicles`
  - `drivers`
  - `trips`
  - `maintenances`
  - `expenses`
- Seed a demo Fleet Manager user and a few example vehicles/drivers

If you prefer auto‑reload during development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### 💻 Frontend: Setup and Run

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. **Run in development mode**

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default Vite serves on `http://localhost:5173`.  
Open this in your browser after the backend is running.

3. **Build for production**

```bash
npm run build
```

4. **Preview production build**

```bash
npm run preview
```

### 🔗 How Frontend and Backend Talk

- The frontend uses `fetch` calls inside `FleetContext.jsx` to talk to the backend.
- Endpoints include (non‑exhaustive):
  - `POST /api/auth/register`
  - `POST /api/auth/login`
  - `GET /api/state`
  - `POST /api/vehicles`
  - `POST /api/vehicles/:id/toggle-shop`
  - `POST /api/trips`
  - `POST /api/trips/:id/complete`
  - `POST /api/maintenances`
  - `POST /api/expenses`
- The API responses update the React context, which re‑renders all modules.

---

### 📐 Business Rules Summary

- Trips:
  - Cannot dispatch if:
    - Cargo weight exceeds vehicle `maxLoad`
    - Driver license status is expired
    - Vehicle is not `Available`
  - Dispatching updates:
    - Trip → `Dispatched`
    - Vehicle → `On Trip`
    - Driver → `On Duty`
  - Completing updates:
    - Trip → `Completed`
    - Vehicle → `Available` (or stays `In Shop` if required)
    - Driver → `Available`

- Maintenance:
  - Logging maintenance for a vehicle:
    - Inserts a row into `maintenances`
    - Sets vehicle status to `In Shop`

- Expenses / Analytics:
  - Fuel entries are stored in `expenses`
  - Frontend computes simple metrics and ROI‑style numbers from backend state

### 🎨 UI / UX Notes

- Light theme with:
  - Off‑white gradient background
  - White cards with soft shadows
  - Rounded corners and ample spacing
- Micro‑interactions:
  - Smooth transitions on buttons, cards, and navigation (`0.3s` cubic‑bezier easing)
  - Hover lift on cards and buttons
  - Glow ring on input focus
  - Animated page transitions when switching modules (fade + slide up)
  - Animated truck GIF driving across a pill‑shaped “road” on Dashboard
- Responsive:
  - Layout collapses gracefully on smaller screens
  - Side panels stack vertically on mobile

---

### ⚠️ Known Limitations / Notes

- Authentication uses plain‑text passwords for simplicity; do not use in production.
- There is no multi‑tenant or advanced permission system; roles are basic.
- MySQL connection assumes a local database; tweak `.env` for remote setups.
- Error handling is intentionally minimal and optimized for learning.

---

### 🚀 Next Ideas

- Add proper password hashing and session/token authentication
- Enhance analytics with charts (e.g., using a small charting library)
- Add pagination and filtering for large fleets
- Add audit logs for dispatch and maintenance actions
